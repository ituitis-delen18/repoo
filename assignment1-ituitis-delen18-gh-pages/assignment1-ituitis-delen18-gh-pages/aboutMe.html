             Currently I am freelancer worker, but I worked on many different companies, with many different teams ,but I prefer 
             to work alone. I mostly enjoy coding mobile & desktop games. I started to learn programming in middle-school ,but 
             I was not that interested. After I finished high-school , I started to programming again and since then I have never stopped.
